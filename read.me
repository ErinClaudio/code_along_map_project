In this particular project, the highlights were as followed:
    Using the folio Library for mapping
    Having the folio Library create an HTML page (which did not work in VS CODE but did in PyCharm)
    Using some of the functions created through the folio Library to be able to use the data in a text file in a meaningful way, i.e. volcano location and altitude
    Additionally, breaking this project down into particular small sections was something that I will find very useful in future projects.
